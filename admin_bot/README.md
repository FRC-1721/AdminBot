# Adminbot

This is the discord bot component.

To get started developing here, you'll need a `BOT_TOKEN`, you can get this by
making your own discord bot here https://discord.com/developers/applications

It can be a bit tricky to setup a server and a bot for testing but its worth it.
Use `^sync` to manually sync any discord slash commands to your development server,
and submit a pr!
