# This file is a large collection of suggestions and advice,
# divided into "general" and specific subteam suggestions.

# Honestly this was started as "suggestions" but kinda became a roast.

everyone:
  - Just being on robotics is enough to ensure you never get laid.
  - A diet of nothing but ramen and coke is sure to get you a degree in robotics.
  - Stop huffing whiteboard markers, you'd be amazed how much better you feel.
  - If you're not addicted to coffee yet, why are you in robotics?

Software Team:
  - Everyone knows its always software's fault, but if only they knew the extent to witch you contributed to the robot's malfunctions.
  - Get off discord and get back to work coding the robot.
  - Fork this repo and add some advice yourself.

Electrical Team:
  - Honestly electrical members are not that bad.
  - You should touch the battery contacts to your tongue, why not? Who's stopping you?

Mechanical Team:
  - Mechanical team, offloading their problems to code since 2006.
  - Good luck lining up those holes.
  - Mechanical team, resetting the accident counter since it was installed

Media:
  - I recommend you get off your phone and contribute to robotics.
  - Just take some pictures its like your only job.

Scouting:
  - Scouters are underappreciated, you have my respect.

Student Mentor:
  - It takes a special kind of person to hang around with highschoolers after they graduate.
  - You're just in it for the alumni buttons.
  - No scholarships for wasting your time with the freshmen :3
